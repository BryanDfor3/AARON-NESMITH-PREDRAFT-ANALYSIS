# Aaron Nesmith - 3PT Shooting Comparison (2020)

Although his season was cut short due to injury in his final season at Vanderbilt, Aaron Nesmith displayed high volume and high accuracy shooting unlike many draft prospects I had analyzed in my database spanning from 2015-2020. Despite a historic shooting start to his season, some scouts and draft analysts had Nesmith's shooting as a question mark, as there was skepticism in whether his significant year-to-year improvement was real or a fallacy given Nesmith's shortened season (3.7 3PM per 100 possessions at 33.7% in 32 games as a freshman the year prior compared to his 6.9 3PM per 100 possessions at 52.2% in 14 games as a sophomore).

As a point of comparison, Buddy Hield, one of the most prolific 3 point shooters in college and NBA history, averaged 3.8 3PM per game at 52.0% in the first 14 games during his final year at Oklahoma, where he ended the season as the Wooden Award winner. Nesmith on a per-game basis was at 4.3 3PM at the aforementioned 52.2%. 

Given this trajectory and the other positive shooting indicators (82.5% on FTs as both a freshman and sophomore), I think it is reasonable to assume that Nesmith would very likely have ended a prolonged 2019-20 season as a 40%+ three point shooter. 

As of the start of the 2024-2025 season, Aaron Nesmith is a career 37.4% 3 point shooter, and just experienced his best shooting season in 2023-24 (1.9 3PM at 41.9%) after signing a 3 year, $33 million extension. Provided that his shooting ability persists at this level and complements his blossoming defensive reputation, this will likely be one of the better bargain contracts in the NBA.
